# Covid-19-app
Covid-19 app made with Java and SQL

This was a basic Java and SQL project based off a scenario question:
The Department of Health keeps track of the number of detected COVID-19 cases in South Africa. As
of this writing, on 10 October 2020, South Africa has a total of 690896 detected cases. 

(The scenario came with a table which you can see in the SQL database)

Develop a Java application for the Department of Health using the information provided in the
table above. Your application should make use of a database. Your application should read the
database and output the results to the user.
